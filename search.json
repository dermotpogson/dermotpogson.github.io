    "section": "",
    "text": "People often think about the NFL from the team’s perspective. Maybe you grew up watching a team, your dad took you to your first game when you were 8, or by some other familial or cultural connection, you found yourself becoming a fan of one particular team. This is an essential part of navigating modern society; finding a group to relate to is healthy and can even make you a bigger fan of the sport. Today, however, is different. Today is all about the players.\nThe journeyman is a recurring role in the NFL. A player who is different from what a team wants in the long term but far too talented to stay out of the league for long. They always seem to find themselves on a roster, even if that means playing for a different team every year. These players are easy to lose track of since they might only be on any given roster for a season or two before leaving again for greener pastures. They often have some of the most unique and compelling stories of any athletes in the league. Today, these legends are being compared head to head to determine who is the NFL Journeyman of the Year based on this year’s metrics of career post-season success.\nTo illustrate this, it helps to have some background knowledge.\nFor this article, a journeyman has been defined as a player who has been on at least 4 teams during their NFL career. Of the top 260 players in NFL history who have played in the most postseason games, 31 played on 4 or more teams. Since this encompasses players across generations and positions, playoff appearances will be used to measure journeyman success. For the interest of this analysis, the emphasis is being put on players who got to the league, found post-season success as efficiently as possible, and then called it a day. That said, it is still important to consider that success for a journeyman is often just getting to play the game. While accolades and trophies are always the goal, it is the nature of these players just to enjoy the ride. These are the people we call “Football Guys”. Their loyalty is to the game itself.\nLet’s start with efficiency—the players who got it done in as few years as possible.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"PlayoffLeaders.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Tm == \"4TM\"|\n    Tm == \"5TM\"|\n    Tm == \"6TM\"|\n    Tm == \"7TM\") |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Name = Player,\n    PlayoffGames = PlayoffGames,\n    Teams = Tm,\n    Years = Years)\n\neverybody&lt;-read_csv(\"PlayoffLeaders.csv\") |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Name = Player,\n    PlayoffGames = PlayoffGames,\n    Teams = Tm,\n    Years = Years) |&gt; \n  mutate(Name=gsub(\"\\\\+.*\",\"\",Name)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"TM\",\"\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  separate(Years, into=c(\"Start\",\"End\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"buf\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"cle\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"clt\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"dal\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"den\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"gnb\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"kan\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"mia\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"min\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"nwe\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"pit\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"rai\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"ram\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"rav\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"sfo\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"was\",\"1\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Teams = as.numeric(Teams),\n    Start = as.numeric(Start),\n    End = as.numeric(End)\n    )\n\njourneymen&lt;-players |&gt; \n  mutate(Name=gsub(\"\\\\+.*\",\"\",Name)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Teams=gsub(\"TM\",\"\",Teams)) |&gt; \n  separate(Years, into=c(\"Start\",\"End\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Teams = as.numeric(Teams),\n    Start = as.numeric(Start),\n    End = as.numeric(End)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    CareerLength = End-Start,\n    PAPT = PlayoffGames/Teams,\n    PAPS = PlayoffGames/CareerLength,\n    PAWS = PAPT*(1/1.352)+PAPS*(1/4.147)) |&gt; \n  group_by(Name) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(PAWS))\n\nra&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Ryan Allen\")\nrj&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Robert Jones\")\nlr&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Logan Ryan\")\ngb&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"George Blanda\")\nbr&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Bill Romanowski\")\nga&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Gary Anderson\")\ndf&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Dwight Freeney\")\ntm&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(Name == \"Tim McKyer\")\njourney15&lt;-journeymen |&gt; filter(PAWS &gt;= 3.344401) |&gt; group_by(Name) |&gt; arrange(desc(PAWS))\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=journeymen, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS),\ncolor=\"darkgrey\")+\n  geom_point(data=ra, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS),\ncolor=\"#002244\")+\n  geom_point(data=rj, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS),\ncolor=\"#003594\")+\n  geom_point(data=lr, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS),\ncolor=\"#002244\")+\n  geom_point(data=gb, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS),\ncolor=\"#C83803\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=ra, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS, label=Name,force=1))+geom_text_repel(data=rj, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS, label=Name,force=1))+geom_text_repel(data=gb, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS, label=Name,force=1))+geom_text_repel(data=lr, aes(x=CareerLength, y=PAPS, label=Name,force=1))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Number of Seasons in Career\", \n    y=\"Playoff Appearances Per Season\", \n    title=\"Which Players Succeeded Efficienctly?\", \n    subtitle=\"Some of these stars burned bright and fast.

As a punter who spent the height of his career with the Patriots during the Brady/Belichick era, Allen has seen his fair share of playoff appearances. He also played for the Falcons, the Colts, and the Titans, securing his spot on this list.\nFollowing Allen is an unlikely tie between Robert Jones, a linebacker known mostly for his stint with the Cowboys, and Logan Ryan, a strong safety out of Ohio University who made his name known on those same Patriots teams as Ryan Allen. These two players had almost identical careers in the playoff appearances department. Both played for 4 teams. Both played for 9 seasons. Both played in 16 postseason games. The only significant separation is in date: Jones wrapped up his career 12 years before Ryan made his debut.\nAs mentioned previously, the beauty of this type of analysis is the attention is drawn to names that some may have forgotten since their tenure. The least efficient award goes to George Blanda. Once a household name and staple of professional football, Blanda Holds the record for being the oldest player to ever play in the NFL when he retired at the ripe age of 48. This man spent 26 years playing quarterback in the NFL. These were not the days of favorable calls for QBs or the modern emphasis on player safety either. From 1949 to 1975, Blanda stood in the pocket for 5 different teams and played his heart out for every minute.\nWhile his legendary career does not earn him points in today’s efficiency ratings, his name remains eternally celebrated in Canton. Talk about a Football Guy.\nThe second half of our considerations for this head-to-head match up comes from each player’s value to their respective organization at any given time. For this calculation, look at the number of playoff game appearances per team played for.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=journeymen, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT),color=\"darkgrey\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(data=br, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT),color=\"#AA0000\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(data=ga, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT),color=\"#FFB612\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(data=df, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT),color=\"#002C5F\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(data=tm, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT),color=\"#AA0000\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=br, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT, label=Name,force=TRUE))+ geom_text_repel(data=ga, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT, label=Name,force=TRUE))+ geom_text_repel(data=df, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT, label=Name,force=TRUE))+ geom_text_repel(data=tm, aes(x=Teams, y=PAPT, label=Name,force=TRUE))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Number of Teams Played for\", \n    y=\"Playoff Appearances Per Team\", \n    title=\"Who Was Winning Everywhere?\", \n    subtitle=\"If you are going to play for a lot of teams, you might as well play for good ones. \\nThese guys didn't let a change of team slow them down.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Dermot Pogson\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThis line of analysis benefits players who were continually successful despite changing teams using PAPT (Playoff Appearances Per Team). Please also consider that when a team is winning, there is more incentive to keep the band together, and having played for fewer teams becomes an asset to a player’s average. When breaking down players into the number of teams played for, a few names float to the top.\nIn the 4s, the clear leader is Bill Romanowski. Romanowksi played linebacker for the 49ers, Eagles, Broncos, and Raiders. The two-time Pro Bowler stood 6’4” and weighed 245, but might be best known for his “spitting incident” in which he was fined $7500 for spitting in the face of 49ers wide receiver JJ Stokes while on the Broncos roster. Don’t let his reputation for anger mismanagement distract you, however, from remembering that he has 4 Super Bowl Rings to his name.\nIn the 5s, Gary Anderson stands a head above the rest. The all-time leading scorer in Steelers history was a lights-out kicker who had a solid tour around the league in his time. The proud owner of 538 career field goals and 820 career extra points should tell you that Anderson is one of the best to ever do it.\nFor the 6s, Dwight Freeney is the most notable. Having played for the Colts, Chargers, Cardinals, Falcons, Lions, and Seahawks, the 7 time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl XLI champion caused havoc for 15 years in the league. While his rating on this list has not benefited from being as well-traveled, he still holds one of the most exciting careers in the game’s history.\nFor the 7s, you’ll notice there is only one name. Tim McKyer might represent this list better than anyone. He spent 12 years in the league, had 33 interceptions, and was a member of the 1986 NFL All Rookie Team. He was also a 3x Super Bowl Champion. That is more than most people on this list or even the world can say.\nBy combining those two points of analysis, a final weighted score can be calculated by dividing both the PAPS and PAPT by their averages and adding them together. This puts both numbers into perspective relative to the other players on the list and, by combining those ratios, ensures that both attributes are evenly considered.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=journey15, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=br, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"#AA0000\")+\n  geom_bar(data=gb, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"#C83803\")+\n  geom_bar(data=ga, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"#FFB612\")+\n  geom_bar(data=rj, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"#003594\")+\n  geom_bar(data=lr, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"#002244\")+\n  geom_bar(data=ra, aes(x=reorder(Name, PAWS), weight=PAWS),fill=\"#002244\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Journeyman Weighted Score\", \n    title=\"Bill Romanowski Wins Journeyman of the Year\", \n    subtitle=\"Based on a weighted score in which PAPS and PAPT are divided by \\ntheir averages and added together.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Dermot Pogson\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()+theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, Bill Romanowski lands on top of our leaderboard. It is hard to argue against; the Boston College alum played in 26 playoff games across 4 teams across 15 years. With a Playoff Appearance Weighted Score of 5.225 he lands comfortably ahead of some admirable competition.\nThis list is not the end-all be-all of journeymen, but rather is designed to remind the world of the stories of players that have been forgotten. While their playing days are over, their legacy lives on. Congratulations to Bill Romanowski on winning this year’s Journeyman of the Year award."

It has a -5.5 game differential, meaning as a conference they lose around 5 and a half games per year more than they win. This is likely why you probably don’t follow them too closely and may be a reason many casual football fans count them out. This, however is in truth a very misleading statistic. Many larger programs like to use MAC teams as tune up games because they are smaller institutions that need the money. When you recognize that the over funded monster conferences at the top are working with a much better hand and refuse to let it sway your opinion on the validity of any given program, you begin the journey of opening your mind to what football is actually supposed to be all about. This leans into the second point to consider: 2) MAC teams play games that they are not expected to win. None of this “oh we gotta protect our record for the post season” whiner crock of bull. The MAC represents the true essence of football. You can shove your hyper commercialized Power 5 teams that play at most 5 games they care about in any given year. Every week is a battle to the death in the MAC and, as their differential shows, somebody has to lose. But that only makes the glory of victory even sweeter. On any given Saturday, any given team could squeak out a win. When every week is a dogfight, you get something even better than dominance: 3) Parity. The greatest word in sports. This alludes to the possibility of teams having a better chance at beating one another. If the conference is losing as a whole, surely the teams themselves must be losing also, making the odds much more favorable that whatever opponent you are facing in a mac conference game has lost to another team at some point this season. The balance of strengths and weaknesses creates a more strategic game relying on learning from mistakes, not just winning all the time or losing all the time.\nLet’s focus on that last part for a second. Parity is a major selling point in the MAC. Why don’t we take a look at how the MAC shakes up relative to larger conferences like the SEC or Big 10.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=AllSchools, \n    aes(x=ConPct, y=ConW, size=ConGames),\n    alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name=\"Conference Games Played\")+\n  geom_point(\n    data=MACSchools,\n    aes(x=ConPct, y=ConW, size=ConGames),\n    color=\"#019E4F\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.4857) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 242.4)+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=MACSchools,\n    aes(x=ConPct, y=ConW, label=School))+\nlabs(\n    title = \"Young and Even: Parity in the MAC\",\n    subtitle = \"All-time conference win percentage vs total conference win qantity. Programs near the middle have experienced more \\nparity than teams near the edges. Here, MAC schools are compared to the SEC and Big 10.\",\n    x = \"All-time Conference Win %\",\n    y = \"Total Conference Wins\",\n  plot.title.position=\"plot\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nThis showcases that there is indeed parity within the MAC on a more universal level than there is in either the Big 10 or the SEC. Many teams are hovering around the mean for win percentage, with the exception of the four teams which just do not win as often. Virtually all of the MAC is on the smaller side for quantity of games played. This is an indicator that the MAC is at an earlier stage in its life cycle as a younger conference. Let’s take a look at the differences between these conferences when you level the playing field of age.\nQuick story, based on what actually went down:\nIn 1892, somebody said “man that Grover Cleveland is having a heck of an election campaign, maybe we oughta create a new collegiate athletic conference!” They made a conference and it was called the Western Conference. It was not until 1953 that they became the actual Big 10 conference. So for the rest of this article, we are going to be treating 1953 as the start date, since if you asked anybody in the 40s about the big 10 they would lock you in the loony bin for “talking crazy” before arming, training, and sending you to liberate a German occupied Europe.\nSimilarly, in 1933 somebody said “it is the heart of the great depression and things are really starting to pop off politically in Europe, maybe we need a new athletic conference!” They created the Southeastern conference, or as we now know it, the SEC.\nYou see, both of these powerhouses have been doing what it is that they do very well for a very long time. With more seasons of play naturally you would expect them to grow and become better organized and supported over time. I think it is important that we level the playing field if we want to compare conferences. The MAC was founded in 1962. That is a pretty substantial false start for the big guys. Instead of comparing the modern MAC to the Modern SEC and B1G, we should use a benchmark of duration. For this example, we’ll go with the 50th season of each respective conference. Specifically, that is 1983 for th SEC, 2003 for the B1G, and 2012 for the MAC.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=MAC50, aes(x=ConPct, y=Off), colour=\"#019E4F\")+\n  geom_point(data=B1G50, aes(x=ConPct, y=OffPPG), colour=\"royalblue\")+\n  geom_point(data=SEC50, aes(x=ConPct, y=Off), colour=\"#ffd046\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=LOBF, aes(x=ConPct, y=Off), method=\"lm\", colour=\"darkgrey\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=names,\n    aes(x=ConPct, y=Off, label=School))+\n  labs(\n    title = \"50th Season Comparison: MAC vs SEC and Big 10\",\n    subtitle = \"This graph compares the performance of several programs during the 50th season of their respective leagues. It uses \\nSeason Conference Wins and Offensive Points per Game to depict the generalized success relative to the mean of \\nall clubs across the three conferences.\",\n    x = \"50th Season Conference Win %\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\",\n  plot.title.position=\"plot\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that stands out to me about this comparison is just how comparable they are. Compared to the average line, many of the MAC Team have a higher ppg than much of the SEC. There is a very even distribution in conference win percentage. If you did not have the context of knowing which teams were which, it would be almost entirely impossible to differentiate these teams by Conferences.\nAnd ultimately, that is the point. Given the life-cycle of the conference, when all other things are equal, the level of competition within the MAC is right on track. That makes right now a perfect opportunity to jump on the MAC train! This is a growing conference and one you are going to want to stick around to see develop.\nI hope this has been informative, and you now feel a bit more familiar with who the MAC is and why they matter. What the stats won’t tell you, however, is just how much fun being a fan of the MAC actually is. They have run heavy teams. They have air raid teams. They have NFL Prospects. They have walk-ons from suburban Cleveland, Ohio. They have tradition and rivalry, love, hate, the joy of victory, the agony of defeat. Hell, the University of Toledo even has had a missile at their stadium aimed directly at the 50 yard-line of Bowling Green’s stadium since 1961. If that doesn’t get your pulse up you might need a doctor.\nLong live the Mid-American Conference. Now go enjoy some maction."
